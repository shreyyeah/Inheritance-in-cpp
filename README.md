# Inheritance-in-cpp
Object-oriented programming has a feature called inheritance that lets you build a new class by copying the properties and methods of an existing class. Code reuse and the modelling of a "is-a" connection between classes are two uses for inheritance. To implement inheritance we follow-
1. define base class
2. create derived class
3. accessing base class memeber
4. create objects and use inheritance.

There are several types of inheritance with its own characteristics and cases-

-Single inheritance- a derived class inherits from only one base class. This is the most common and straightforward form of inheritance.

-Multiple inheritance- a derived class can inherit from multiple base classes. This allows the derived class to inherit attributes and behaviors from multiple sources.

-Multilevel inheritance- a class is derived from another derived class. This creates a chain of inheritance.

-Hierarchical inheritance- multiple classes are derived from a single base class. This is useful when multiple classes share common attributes and behaviors.

-Hybrid inheritance- a combination of two or more types of inheritance mentioned above. It often involves multiple and multilevel inheritance.
